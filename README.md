# restApiChatApp
An android application just like whatsapp where you can message other users which exists in your phone directory. The database to record user details along with messages was MySQL. The data was sent and recieved from the database using RESTful APIs through JSON objects. The code for integration is available in PHP files folder. The application doesn't require internet connectivity since it has functionality to store data in local databse and when the phone gets connected to internet, the syncing process occures(BroadCast Reciever is used). Incase you register for the app or send message without connectivity, it will store the data in the local SQLite database.
